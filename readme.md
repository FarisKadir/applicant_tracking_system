## Description

I created this application for small businesses. As small business owners start to hire employees due to the nation recoving from the pandemic they may not have the funds to pay recruiters or sites like indeed.com, linkedIn. This app allows them to take their job posting and applicant screenings in their own hands. The administrator can view, create, edit or delete job openings. They can also view the number of applications that have been submitted for each job opening. As an applicant, they can view all existing job openings along with the job opening description, responsibilites, salary, etc. The applicant can also apply to job openings and view a list of all the jobs they've applied to already. Both the admin and applicant can edit their user profile information. Applicants can also authenticate using their google account.
